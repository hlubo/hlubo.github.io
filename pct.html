		   <p> 
            This week’s scoop includes resident 3IB lovebirds Dan Hlubocky and Natalie Bichler. The sweethearts have been going strong for around half a year and they honestly couldn’t be any cuter. They first met as fetuses in 2015 and Dan and Nat were only 15 or 16 at the time. They basically started off in an enemies to lovers AU, with Nat taking the uptight valedictorian role and Dan starring as the foreign badboy who went out to town every Friday. They didn’t get eachother and came from different worlds. MYP5 brought giant change, and suddenly Nat and her squad were no longer as salty and less saddidy. They started hanging out in the same friendgroup and eventually, at the end of the year trip, Nat confessed and they became a summer fling. They then hooked back up in Winter and decided to go steady. The rest is history. </p>

		   Fashion wise this couple is always snatched. From Tommy to Ford, these matching halves can’t be found out of style. Natalie is the designer in this ship, but Danny has definitely rub off on her in an interesting way. Their style isn’t necessarily haute couture but they have been matchy-matchy on multiple occasions and we here at LCS think it’s absolutely adorable. Their honey-sweet glances and subtle touches complete the soulmate get-up and add an aura of puppy love. This power couple, though young, are very in love with each other and we hope that the highschool sweethearts can stay as infatuated as in style. <br> Write'cha later, </br> <br> B </br>
