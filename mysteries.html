		   <p> 
              <b>Diggy.</b> It’s been a few years since I first heard this name. Until now no one really knows what exactly happened. We at LCS think it’s about time. So we put our best reporters, agents, and editors on the case. What we found out may shock you, so insanely chilling and scary our hearts drop at the mention of the name: Diggy.
              From our in depth research we found out that Diggy was a 9th grader who didn’t care about school. He had bad grades, didn’t listen to teachers, and almost got suspended multiple times. He was taking his bike down to the basement in the left wing of the school to chain it up to a radiator. This is where Diggy took his last breath of life. He slipped on the stairs and fell all the way to the bottom. What made him fall? Nobody knows.
           </p>
		   <p>
              His ghost has been spotted multiple times peering up from the basement. There are theories that might explain his untimely death and why he’s still here, watching us.
              The first theory states that he saw something super scary that made him slip? What was the super scary thing? Hopefully no one else will find out because Diggy protects this by scaring the students away. <br>See you next time,</br> <br>
