		   <p> 
             All students at GJH were bamboozled when they first heard of Julia Nash’s fatality. A walking meme, Julia Nash was only 14 when suddenly she disappeared into the basement. What was meant to be a funny suddenly became a frightmare and nobody knows what really happened. The coroner and police are frighteningly silent about the whole ordeal and the investigation was suspiciously short and super shady. No blood spatters, gunshot residue, petechial hemorrhaging or even murder weapons have been found/suspected and friends have testified that “..one moment she was there, and the next it was dark and she was gone…”. This screams foulplay to us here at LCS, so we started an investigation and looked into this now cold case for new clues or theories. </p>
			<p class="dark">Our findings conclude that Julia was in fact attacked by some kind of supernatural entity. No person was down there except for Julia and her friends. There is no other explanation as to why this event could have happened, and our strongest proof is the video on the sidebar. This video was taken moments before Julia’s disappearance and approximately 8 hours before she was found. Viewer discretion is advised.
